## Features
* Knock on haunted houses and interact with NPCs
* Randomized Trick-or-Treat outcomes (rewards or pranks)
  * Rewards: Candy, chocolate, lollipops, or money
  * Pranks: Drunk effect, rat transformation, fake explosion
* Configurable reward chance and cooldown between houses
* Multiple NPC models and names for variety
* Dynamic dialogues with multiple languages (`locales/*.json`)
  * Easy to add new languages (e.g. `en.json`, `pt.json`)
  * Default language configurable via `Config.Locale`
* Integration with inventory systems: ox_inventory or qb_inventory
* Optional map blips showing haunted houses
* Auto-remove NPC if player walks away
* Lightweight and easy to integrate into QBCore or Qbox servers

## Installation
1. Place the resource folder in your `resources` directory.
2. Add to your `server.cfg`:
3. Configure your `Config.lua`:
   * Set `Locale` (`"en"` or `"pt"`)
   * Choose your `InventorySystem` (`"ox"` or `"qb"`)
   * Adjust cooldown, reward chance, and NPC models as desired
4. Add candy or money items to your inventory system (example for QBCore):
